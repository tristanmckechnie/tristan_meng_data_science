# Explanation of notebooks

The notebooks in this folder were used during development:  various modelling techniques, evaluation metrics and validation of ML models. Specificically each notebooks investigated and served as initial exploration:

- hyperparameter_tuning_cross_validation.ipynb: perform hyperparameter tuning, using cross validation for sklearn models.
- lstm_play_ground.ipynd: building a generalised LSTM model using Keras and hyperparameter tuning using the Keras_tuner module.
- Single_step_ahead_univariate_forecasting.ipynbd: initial sandbox environment for building a python module to perfrom generalised one dimensional time series forecasting.
- some_validation_work.ipynb and Validate_against_Jason_Brownlee.ipynb: these notebooks were used to validate the ML forecasting pipeline developed against known problems and results. These serve as a sanity check.
- walk_forward_validation.ipynb: sandbox enviroment for developing code to run walk forward validation for time series forecasting problem.
